        <p><span class="darkgoldenrod">Purpose:</span>    The purpose of this project is to design and implement a secure and scalable infrastructure for a 2-tier application within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 
            By utilizing private subnets, NAT Gateway, and auto-scaling groups, the aim is to enhance security, network isolation, and ensure high availability of the application while enabling seamless internet access for necessary components.</p></center>

        <center><h2><span class="darkgoldenrod">Solution</span></h2>
    <p><span class="darkgoldenrod">VPC Architecture Design: </span>A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was designed to provide an isolated network environment for the application. Private subnets were utilized to segregate different tiers of the application for enhanced security.
    The VPC was logically divided into public and private subnets, with public subnets containing resources accessible from the internet and private subnets housing backend servers and databases.
<br><br>      
<span class="darkgoldenrod">NAT Gateway Configuration: </span>To allow servers in the private subnets to access the internet securely, a NAT Gateway was configured within the VPC.
The NAT Gateway allows outbound internet traffic from the private subnets while preventing inbound traffic initiated from the internet, thus maintaining a secure network environment.
 <br><br>       
 <span class="darkgoldenrod">Auto-Scaling Groups Implementation: </span>Auto-scaling groups were implemented to manage the lifecycle of EC2 instances running in the private subnets.
 By defining scaling policies based on metrics such as CPU utilization or network traffic, the auto-scaling groups automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances to meet demand, ensuring scalability and high availability of the application. </p>

    <p>" This solution provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for the 2-tier application within a secure Virtual Private Cloud environment. 
        It ensures efficient management of resources, enhances security through network isolation, and maintains high availability by dynamically scaling resources based on demand."</p>
